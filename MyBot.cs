    /* OLD TO-DO [coming back after a while ima just leave this here just incase but probably just ignore it]
     * 
     * * After the main search, have a searchAllCaptures function that just will just keep looking until all captures are done,
     * then that final position can be evaluated.
     * 
     * * Don't have a fixed depth and instead just start at depth 1 ply, and keep increasing (using the previous depths as ordering
     * to help α-β pruning) until certain time condition that forces it to move, maybe once the msThisTurn * 10 < msRemaining then
     * stop. This will hopefully fix the running out of time problem, but also just drastically increase time efficiency by pruning
     * more.
     * 
     * * I'm pretty sure the defense stuff isn't fully working since those squares are blocked for sliding pieces.
     * 
     * * Run a little tournament to find weights for the stats.
     * 
     * * Reduce tokens by simplying alpha and beta bits, u can simply swap alpha and beta and negate both of them, rather than
     * using the white to move to determine which one to take and have basically double the code for that bit.

         * 
         * Pretty much everyone is going to have the same minimax searching and stuff, so in order to win I need to focus on the
         * eval. You can just do the trivial thing of using the known average material values, but that is kind of lame, and also
         * just ignores a lot of things that can make positions better or worse. You can do what you did and have like tables of
         * good squares and such. But I thought this skips the most obvious thing, why not just see how good the pieces are for
         * myself? So yeah I'm not putting on any of my values for pieces, here we will just see how valuable they are. Also
         * with some slight modifications I imagine this will let you calculate how good pieces are in a game which is cool.
         * 
         * Anyways so on to what I ended up doing. I calculated 5 stats, hp is the amount of pieces you have, honestly not really
         * important I just thought it fit the theme and its short enough to add, attack is the amount of squares you attack
         * (this includes squares you attack multiple times), defense is the amount of squares you defend, speed is the amount
         * of squares you can move without capture to (useful for seeing squares you control, or have the potential to capture on),
         * and finally dexterity is the amount of squares you could move to if there were no other pieces on the board (useful
         * to see if it's a useful piece, and if it's in a useful spot).
         * 
         * Then I just did a bit of trial and error to find the best weights for combining them. And then well combined them.
         * Also you will see when I use this function I calculate both black and white and subtract them. As a move might give you
         * a good position but your opponent an even better one. And just a general note this isn't normalised, so the eval this
         * gives is not directly comparable to a typical eval, I guess you'd have to take the average eval difference of a bunch
         * of positions with and without a random pawn and use that to scale it.
