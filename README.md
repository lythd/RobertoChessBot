# RobertoChessBot
A Chess Bot I made for Sebatian Lague's chess bot competition. It placed 293th out of 624 total bots, so top 50% woo!

Competition Github (if you want to run the bot come here and use the bot as MyBot.cs): https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge

## Explanation
I wanted to have fun with this, so I made the eval function inspired by an rpg. It rates positions based on 5 stats, hp (how many pieces are there, aka how many hits it can take), attack (how many attacks are possible), defense (how many pieces are being defended), speed (how many squares can be traveled to), and dexterity (how many squares could be traveled to if there was no other pieces). I hope you like this presumably unique idea, even if it might not perform as well as if I included standard piece values. More info is in the comments of my code.

I hope you all like it!
